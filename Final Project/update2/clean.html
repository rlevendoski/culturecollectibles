        <h2><u>Cleaning</u></h2>
        <p>Cleaning your collectibles is usually pretty simple, 
        especially with routine cleaning.<br>
        Here are some great options, most of which you should 
        have at home or could easily obtain.<br></p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Microfiber cloth:</b> This is your best bet for most collectibles.</li><br>
        <li><b>Air:</b> This can be done with <a href="https://tinyurl.com/388rbpbs">Air in a Can</a> or a vacuum with the reverse suction feature.<br>
            <i><sub>*Great for Lego sets!</i></sub></li><br>
        <li><b>Damp Cloth:</b> Carefully wipe down any tough-to-remove dust or dirt using 
        a damp cloth. A mild soap or cleaner can also be used for extra tough grime.<br> 
            <i>*Use your common sense with this and do not use water on anything
            that can be damaged by moisture.</i></li><br>
        <li><b><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3jb5shkw">Goo Gone:</a></b> This is great for removing any sticky substance, such as residue from stickers.<br>
        <i><sub>*A little bit goes a <b>long way</b>, so don't overdo it. Great for book covers.</sub></i></li></ul>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Care</u></h2>
        <p>Taking care of your collectibles is also fairly easy.
            Here are some of the basic ground rules.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Do not display collectibles in direct sunlight. Doing so will cause sun damage or bleaching.</li><br>
        <li>Make sure all shelves or pedestals are secure, with wall anchors or other safety mechanisms.</li><br>
        <li>Be careful displaying items in high-traffic areas, especially if they
            have elements that stick out. These can easily snag on you/your clothing
            as you walk by. This includes areas frequented by pets.</li><br>
        <li>Keep collectibles out of reach of pets. Keep your pets natural behaviors in mind. 
            Climbing, scratching, chewing, scenting, and marking are just a few natural pet behaviors that can be damaging.</li><br></ul>
