        <h2><u>Cleaning</u></h2>
        <p>Cleaning your collectibles is usually pretty simple, 
        especially with routine cleaning.<br>
        Here are some great options, most of which you should 
        have at home or could easily obtain.<br></p>
        <li><b>Microfiber cloth:</b> This is your best bet for most collectibles.</li><br>
        <li><b>Air:</b> This can be done with <a href="https://tinyurl.com/388rbpbs">Air in a Can</a> or a vacuum with the reverse suction feature.<br>
        *Great for Lego sets!</li><br>
        <li><b>Damp Cloth:</b> Carefully wipe down any tough-to-remove dust or dirt using 
        a damp cloth. A mild soap or cleaner can also be used for extra tough grime.<br> 
        *Use your common sense with this and do not use water on anything
        that can be damaged by moisture.</li><br>
        <li><b><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3jb5shkw">Goo Gone:</a></b> This is great for removing any sticky substance, such as residue from stickers.<br>
        *A little bit goes a <i>long way</i>, so don't overdo it. Great for book covers.</li>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Care</u></h2>
        <p>Taking care of your collectibles is also fairly easy.
            Here are some of the basic ground rules.</p>
            <br>
        <li>Do not display collectibles in direct sunlight. Doing so will cause sun damage or bleaching.</li>
        <li>Be careful displaying items in high-traffic areas, especially if they
            have elements that stick out. These can easily snag on you/your clothing
            as you walk by. This includes areas frequented by pets.</li>
        <li>Keep your precious collectibles out of reach of pets. Pets are curious
            and their natural habits can sometimes spell disaster for collectibles.
            Cats can be especially tricky to work around! Please keep your pets 
                natural behaviors in mind. Climbing, scratching, chewing, scenting,
                and marking are just a few natural pet behaviors that can be damaging.</li>
        </ul>
